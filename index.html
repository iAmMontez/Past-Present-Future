<p> I (Montez Caldwell-Gary) was born in Greenville, South Carolina on August 31, 2000 and I have lived here all my life, all of my family lives in Greenville as well, but they have not lived here all their life. My mom is from Detroit, Michigan which is where she met my father. Then they moved down here when they found out my mother was pregnant with my sister. </p>

<p>I am now 16, a junior at J.L. Mann, I live with my mom and dad, with me being the smallest child, I have one sister and two brothers that have all moved out. I worked at <a href="https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us.html"> McDonalds</a> for about 5 months and then quit due to low paychecks with bad hours. Although I had a lot of friends that worked there, it just wasnt worth being there unhappy. I am now filling in multiple applications for different places with better pay.</p>
